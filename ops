Would it working in WSL be useful for you?\n* OSX seems to have some ptrace support as per [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptrace#Support). There is a [man page](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/System/Conceptual/ManPages_iPhoneOS/man2/ptrace.2.html) and also http://www.hexblog.com/?p=81 and https://www.spaceflint.com/?p=150. People seem to complain about \"lacking documentation\".\n\nI have only tested hatrace and strace on Linux.\n\nIf WSL is sufficient for you, would you be up for checking what ptrace flags or features it supports? Then I could tell you how well hatrace is supposed to work there.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"4e48b1cd3f4846dfd94f5b4a0dc5aad8a9abdf44"},"timestamp":1552666701,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MzM0OTg0NA==","github-url":"https://github.com/nh2/hatrace/issues/1#issuecomment-473349844"},"message":"Unfortunately I don't have WSL installed.
